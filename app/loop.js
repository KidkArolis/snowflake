    // We can set slow to smth like 5, which slows down the game
    // 5 times, e.g. 1 second of gameplay happens over 5 seconds of real
    // time. But in this case, the rendering becomes janky, since we only
    // advance the state of the world every step * 5 s. What we need to do
    // is somehow interpolate the position of the snowflake based on previous
    // position, next position and current time, or alpha = acc / slow.
    // This is not essential to the game, but it's a fun thing to explore since
    // it breaks the React paradigm somewhat in that I don't have prev/next state
    // handily available for interpolation in a way that doesn't affect the physics
    // engine in gravity.js.
    // let alpha = acc / slow

    // console.log('Updating with', frameTime * slow)
    // state = update(state, t, frameTime * slow) // this is bypassing the update cycle above
